POE Part 3 
Interactive Features and JavaScript Implementation 

Core JavaScript Integration: I successfully developed and implemented the central Javascript/Script.js file, linking it across all necessary HTML pages. This established a single, efficient hub for managing all interactive site features. 

Search Functionality Development (2.1): I integrated a user-friendly search bar into the navigation header. I then implemented the underlying JavaScript logic, which currently uses a basic alert function to demonstrate interactive query capture and simulated search capability. 

Borrowing/Cart Feature (New): I developed new JavaScript functionality to track a user's book selections. This involved setting a maximum borrowing limit of 5 items, updating a visible cart counter, and providing clear, instantaneous visual feedback upon clicking the "Book to borrow" button. 

Client-Side Animations: I meticulously verified and maintained all existing basic JavaScript client-side animations and UI effects to guarantee a smooth, professional, and consistent user experience across the entire site (2.1). 

 

Form Development, Validation, and External Service Integration 

Form Creation: 

Enquiry Form: I designed and implemented a comprehensive Enquiry Form on the volunteer.html page to capture detailed user intent, including interest in services, products, volunteering, or sponsoring. 

Contact Form: I developed a streamlined Contact Form on contact.html for general messages, prioritizing ease of use and quick communication. 

Email Validation: I built a validation logic for both forms to ensure data quality. This included requiring all necessary fields, enforcing correct email formatting using regular expressions, and validating minimum phone number length. 

External Service Integration (EmailJS): I successfully integrated the EmailJS library into the project, which required troubleshooting and correctly linking the external Content Delivery Network (CDN) to resolve initialization errors. This now enables real, reliable email sending upon form submission. 

Submission Handling: I implemented advanced JavaScript logic to simulate asynchronous form submission, providing users with professional feedback ("Sending...") and confirmation alerts after successful data transmission. 

 

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Implementation 

On-Page SEO Optimization (3.1): I systematically updated the <meta name="description"> tags across all pages with unique and compelling content to improve potential click-through rates (CTR) from search engines. I also refined the <meta name="keywords"> tags to target high-value, domain-specific search terms. 

Design and Layout Refinements 

Navigation CSS Modification: I implemented targeted modifications to the main-nav CSS, adjusting the layout to create balanced visual spacing. 

Header Integration: These CSS refinements allowed me to seamlessly and professionally integrate the new search bar element on the far right of the header, maintaining the overall aesthetic quality of the site.
